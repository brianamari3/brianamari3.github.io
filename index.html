  <p id="one">"The word 'happy' would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness." "To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering." "To know, is to know that you know nothing. That is the meaning of true knowledge." "Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another." "I think it's important to get your surroundings as well as yourself into a positive state - meaning surround yourself with positive people, not the kind who are negative and jealous of everything you do." "When you draw or paint a tree, you do not imitate the tree; you do not copy it exactly as it is, which would be mere photography. To be free to paint a tree or a flower or a sunset, you have to feel what it conveys to you: the significance, the meaning of it."~inspired by amanda zerquera</p>
  <p id="two">"I believe that we are who we choose to be. Nobody’s going to come and save you, you’ve got to save yourself. Nobody’s going to give you anything. You’ve got to go out and fight for it. Nobody knows what you want except for you. And nobody will be as sorry as you if you don’t get it. So don’t give up on your dreams."</p>
